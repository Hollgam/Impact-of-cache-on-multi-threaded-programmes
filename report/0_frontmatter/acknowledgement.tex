Special thanks should be given to Dr Stephen Brown, my research project supervisor for his professional guidance and valuable support and to Niall O'Connell from Openet for his useful and constructive recommendations on this project. I would like to show my gratitude to the EACEA (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency) for funding my research, as well as my two-year long join Master's programme that has changed my life and proved that nothing is impossible. Assistance and help provided by Openet was greatly appreciated.

I would also like to extend my thanks to the technicians of the laboratory of the department of Computer Science of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth for their help in offering me the resources for conducting this study. I want to especially show my gratitude to Dr Vanush Paturyan, I would not be able to handle Linux without him.

Finally, I wish to thank my family for their support and encouragement throughout my study. Specifically, Dasha for giving me motivation to conquer new horizons and improve myself.
